    <h1>My First Web Page</h1>
    <p> My name is Timothy Thao, Something I find interested is playing RPG (Role playing Game) and one of my favorite RPG is <strong>Monster</strong><strong>Hunter</strong>.
      Monster hunter is an RPG (Role Playing Game) and RNG (Random Number Generators) created by capcom. The same company that created street fighter, puzzle fighter, resident evil..etc. 
    <h2>A brief History</h2>  
      The Monster hunter was introduce in 2004 only for the ps2 (playStation 2). 
      However, even though the the franchise itself has been out since 2004, many people still haven't respect its franchise until MHW (monster hunter world). MHW sold over 
      17 billions copies worldwide making it capcoms biggest game sold and finally making the monster hunter franchise finally known in the gaming community.
    <h2>What You Do in the Game</h2>  
      You hunt different variety of monsters and make them into your armor and weapon.
